```

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Issues encountered

- No logo attached to the test file
- No mute speaker icon attached to the test file
- Refresh icon not aligned to the text-content box in the mobile view

## Solution

- Downloaded Nominis logo from the company's website and added to the assets folder
- Downloaded Mute speaker icon from the company's website and added to the assets folder
  -Aligned refresh icon to the text-content box

## Things to make the Application Better For better user experience for children

- Fun rotate animation onclick of the refresh button

# Things to make it better for developers on a team

- Switch to typescript

## Observations
Since from your website link you provided on the pdf, the speaker was able to toggle between on and off and the heart value decreases and increases based on the correct answers . I decided to put them into their own components to make it easier to integrate functionalities in the future .
